# ardac-toolbox

Notebooks, modules, and more to expose SNAP data holdings and the SNAP Data API.

## What is this?

This repository is a place to store notebooks, modules, widgets, and code that might be used in ARDAC. This repo is a work in progress and all content should considered incomplete.

The `environment.yml` file is current as of 12/8/23, and users should be able to run all notebooks using a virtual environment built using that file. Be aware that any additional revisions to the notebooks, or additions of new notebooks after this date may require updating this environment.
