# ardac-toolbox

Notebooks, modules, and more to expose SNAP data holdings and the SNAP Data API.

## What is this?

This repository is a place to store notebooks, modules, widgets, and code that might be used in ARDAC. This repo is a work in progress and all content should considered incomplete.

A virtual environment built from the main `environment.yml` file should be able to run all notebooks in the "notebooks" directory. A virtual environment built from the `mercury_environment.yml` file should be able to run all notebooks in the "mercury_notebooks" directory.

Be aware that any additional revisions to the notebooks, or additions of new notebooks may require updating these environments.
