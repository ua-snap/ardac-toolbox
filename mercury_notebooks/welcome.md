# ARDAC Notebooks in Mercury!

### Aren't these nice?

Below are all of the notebooks located in the directory where you executed `mercury run`. The text you are now reading is automatically read from `welcome.md` located in the same directory.

Besides what we can format via Markdown, there is little in the way of customization for this page re: layout, graphics, colors, etc. Unless we pay [$1000/yr](https://runmercury.com/pricing/) ðŸ˜…

Notebook titles and descriptive text are set within the notebooks.
