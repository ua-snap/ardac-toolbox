The function appends each `id` to an API request, and returns zonal statistics for the corresponding polygon. **This function will only work with polygons and polygon IDs recognized by the SNAP Data API!** You cannot just use any polygon ID - it must be one of the IDs referenced in the API documentation [here](https://earthmaps.io/boundary/#:~:text=Service%20endpoints-,Available%20places,-Query%20a%20list) under \"available places\". \n",

In these cases, it is better to use a latitude / longitude point query instead of a polygon. You will notice below that several small protected areas do not return any beetles data. This could be because the beetles dataset does not cover these areas, but in this case it is more likely that these polygons are simply smaller than an individual raster cell."
